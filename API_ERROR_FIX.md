# ✅ API 500 Error Fixed!

## 🔧 Issues Fixed

### **1. 500 Internal Server Error**
- **Problem:** `appointments.json` file didn't exist
- **Error:** Server crashed when trying to read non-existent file
- **Solution:** Added `appointments.json` to initialization
- **Result:** API now works perfectly!

### **2. Form Validation Error**
- **Problem:** "An invalid form control with name='preferredType' is not focusable"
- **Cause:** Hidden radio buttons with `required` but none checked
- **Solution:** Set "Video Call" as default checked
- **Result:** Form submits without errors!

### **3. Visual Feedback**
- **Problem:** No visual indication of selected meeting type
- **Solution:** Added JavaScript to highlight selected option
- **Result:** Users can see which option is selected!

# After
files = {
    'moods.json': [],
    'users.json': [],
