## 🔧 Troubleshooting Demo

### **Problem: Still seeing default recommendations**
**Check:**
1. Have you logged at least 2 moods?
2. Is the console showing "✨ AI generated..."?
3. Refresh the page after logging moods

### **Problem: "AI recommendation error" in console**
**Cause:** API issue
**Solution:** App automatically falls back to defaults
**Impact:** No breaking - users still get recommendations

### **Problem: Recommendations not updating**
**Solution:** 
- Hard refresh: `Ctrl + Shift + R`
- Check `data/moods.json` has entries
- Restart Flask server
